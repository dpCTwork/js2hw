    <h3>2 Codewars problems solved in JS. (1 already solved in Python, 1 new in JS)</h3> 
</p>
Questions and my solutions below, with links to the problems.

<h4>
    Problem 1: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/54c27d56111ec18e6c0003c1/groups/58b0ad1300a23a45b500004e">You're a Square! A square of squares</a><br> (already done in Python)
</h4>
<pre style="font-family: sans-serif;">
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to
arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted
things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check
if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is
the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1 => false
0 => true
3 => false
4 => true
25 => true
26 => false
<h4>SOLUTION</h4><code>
var isSquare = function(n){
    if ((n > -1) && (Math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0)){
    return true
    }
    return false; 
}</code>

<h4>Problem 2: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/5c8bfbbf3b8ec2000116c7cb/groups/64e642f9c5be680001bfa4ed">A wolf in sheep's clothing</a><br> (new JS Codewars problem)
</h4>
<pre style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to
be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.

Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing at the front of the
queue which is at the end of the array:

<code>
[sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep] (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)
   7      6      5      4      3            2      1
</code>
If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return <em>"Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"</em>. Otherwise, return <em>"Oi! Sheep
number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"</em> where N is the sheep's position in the queue.

Note: there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.

Examples
<code>Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep"]
Output: "Oi! Sheep number 1! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"

Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "wolf"]
Output: "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"</code>
<h4>SOLUTION</h4><code>
function warnTheSheep(queue) {
    queue.reverse()
    if (queue.indexOf('wolf') !== 0){
        return `Oi! Sheep number ${queue.indexOf('wolf')}! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!`
    }
    return `Pls go away and stop eating my sheep`
}</code>
